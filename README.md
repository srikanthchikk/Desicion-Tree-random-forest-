# Desicion-Tree-random-forest-
Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems. Decision Tree uses a flowchart like a tree structure to show the predictions that result from a series of feature-based splits. It starts with a root node and ends with a decision made by leaves.  Random Forest A random forest is a machine learning technique that’s used to solve regression and classification problems. It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems.  A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees. The ‘forest’ generated by the random forest algorithm is trained through bagging or bootstrap aggregating.
